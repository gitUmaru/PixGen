# medhacks2020

We have decided to make a web application where clinicians can decide to add and request images of skins lesions from POC.

## Demo


## Built with
- Tensorflow (TF) / TF Keras API
- React

## Installation

```
pip install virtualenv

virtualenv env

env\scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For whatever reason GitHub kept telling me that Pillow had a vulnerability issue so please install pillow separately.

```
pip install Pillow
```
