# PixGen
Our team's web app aids physicians and other healthcare providers in uploading pictures of their patientsâ€™ skin lesions, creating an open-source database of skin conditions in patients with darker skin tones. We then plan to use this database in downstream machine learning algorithms, including training a DCGAN to generate even more examples of skin conditions in darker skin tones. Our goal is to increase the visibility of skin conditions in all skin tones and remove cognitive biases that contribute to poorer health outcomes in minorities.

## Inspiration
In the news, there has been a lot of talk about the dermatological symptoms associated with COVID-19 infection, even if the individual is otherwise asymptomatic. These symptoms may include rash, blisters, or itchy hives. While researching this topic, our team began to realize that **skin conditions related to COVID-19 may look different between patients with fair skin and those with darker skin**. A paper by Lester et al demonstrated that in a systematic review of pictures in scientific articles describing skin manifestations associated with COVID-19, 93% (120 out of 130) were taken with patients with the three fairest skin tones (Types I-III). 6% (7 out of 130) showed patients with Type IV skin, and **there was no representation of the darkest skin tones (Type V and VI)**. This can lead to cognitive biases that contribute to underdiagnosis of COVID-19 infection in patients with darker skin that are otherwise asymptomatic.

This issue isn't just limited to COVID-19 though. Turns out, **many other skin conditions that present differently in patients with dark skin compared to those with fair skin**.

The following is an example of atopic dermatitis in an infant with dark skin compared to one with fair skin.
We have decided to make a web application where clinicians can decide to add and request images of skins lesions from POC.
