# medhacks2020

This project is motivated by a free data set that I found online from the IEEE Biomedical Society, it contains very hard to distinguish image samples of cancer and healthy cells. In this project I hope to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify such images. I want to use both Google's Tensorflow API and the teachable machine website (MobileNet) for quick and easy deployment.

## Demo


## Built with
- Tensorflow (TF) / TF Keras API
- React

## Installation

```
pip install virtualenv

virtualenv env

env\scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For whatever reason GitHub kept telling me that Pillow had a vulnerability issue so please install pillow separately.

```
pip install Pillow
```

## Results
TDB
